# dance-line
Dance Line is a game inspired by playing countless hours of Nokia's 1998 Snake game.

**Goals:** Build the longest line of dancers possible. Pick up dancers to grow your line.
**Rules:** Don't hit walls. Don't crash into your own line. 

The longer your line, the faster you'll go.

Good luck!
